Bootstrap is an amazing set of pure CSS3 / HTML 5 components, while EmberJs amazes in its beauty of
making web applications right.

You can just hook both projects together by using Bootstrap as is in Handlebars templates,
But soon enough, you will find yourself asking questions sucha s:

* How do I interact between Bootstrap events and Ember (such as Controllers)?
* How to pass Bootstrap components data from Ember (such as Controllers)

I've seen few options about the integration between both, but:

* They are not easy and fun to use, they make the ease of Bootstrap too complex.
* They are not well documented.
* Development is too slow, I haven't seen anything new lately.


So! I'm excited about a project I've been working lately with some guys to integrate Bootstrap & EmberJs together in a way that
doesnt make Bootstrap usage more complex than using it as-is but providing great integration with EmberJs components.
