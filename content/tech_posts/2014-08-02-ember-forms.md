_Smart, Intuitive forms for Ember.js styled with Bootstrap, Multi layouts and Validation support._

As my favorite web framework is _emberjs_, I lately needed forms support for one of my projects with the following set of features in mind:

* Styled for Bootstrap but easy to stil differently.
* Different layouts such _inline_ and _horizontal_
* Validations where validation rules are defined in model/controller and _form_ supports for:
  * Change color & icons when validation rule fails.
  * Show error message per form input.
  * Submit button with async support that changes its styles & get disabled during async call.
