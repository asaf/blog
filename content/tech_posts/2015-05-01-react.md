title: Facebook React - simplified work flow.

React is a really game changer in the world of web development,
As most web frameworks (such Angular, Ember, etc) supports [two way bindings](http://https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_04) that really simplifies
development life, when applications start to get bigger things start to get clashed
as multiple views may be bound to multiple models and getting
unexpected behaviors is not something imaginary,

React solve these problems by exposing a new flow that is based on unidirectional
binding, combined with the usage of [virtual DOM](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/glossary.html),
DOM reconciliation should result a better performance than two way bindings based
frameworks, Well, if Facebook uses it, then it scales :)

You can read about it in [React's web site](https://facebook.github.io/react),
especially the [Tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) should
give you a great starting point,

Watch out my next post about how to setup a React environment using great tools
that will simplify your development lifecycle.
