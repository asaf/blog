Introducing a new Ember Components suite!

Ember Components is a set of rich web components written for Ember.js that let you create an astonishing UI for ambitious web applications.

This project aims to be the successor of our Bootstrap for Ember project as all components on this suite are not bound to any specific CSS framework.
